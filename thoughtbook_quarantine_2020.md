 Co-evolving microbial communties; communities as an optimization problem solver; communities co-evolution as a learning algorithm; selective conditions and co-evolution strategies, abstract and historical, that lead to general intelligence # Day 4: 200317
 Happy St. Patricks Day.

 Co-evolving microbial communties; communities as an optimization problem solver; communities co-evolution as a learning algorithm; selective conditions and co-evolution strategies, abstract and historical, that lead to general intelligence; analogies to co-evolving neural networks, and transplantation thereof to other environments; do transplanted models/organisms thrive, die out, fix in the population? does this affect the consortium's strategy and fitness?
